          <p>Larvae are able to obtain favorable traits for a low pH environment from their mothers. Shellfish are generally able to acclimate to the low pH environment and are able to pass that acclimatization to the offspring. Larger shells and faster development rates are favorable as these traits allow larvae to build defenses quickly. The hypothesis behind this phenomenon is greater maternal investment, in which the mother mollusk will invest more energy into conveying favorable traits into its offspring, often at the cost of its own maintenance and reducing the number of offspring.</p>
          <p>With less offspring being produced and lowered survival rates of mollusk larvae, a fewer number of adults join the population and pass on their acclimatation. This would account for the declining population. However, due to favorable traits being conveyed between generations, it is possible that shellfish populations will adjust to the lower pH in the ocean. This may be reliant on environmental history, as populations in areas of large pH fluctuations would have a history of adjusting to pH change.</p>
          <p>Even so, it is just as likely that the opposite will happen. The study on the Olympia oyster found shell size to decrease between generations, so maternal investment cannot be relied upon to raise population numbers. As lower pH puts stress on the mollusks, populations not used to pH change may struggle to reproduce.</p>
